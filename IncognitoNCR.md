# Incognito NCR Extension Privacy Policy - Version 1, October 2024

This extension does not collect or store personal data.

To accomplish its purpose, when you open a new Incognito window, the extension does a request to https://google.com/ncr,
and reads the NID cookie returned in the response. This cookie is set for google.com for the duration of that Incognito session.
This behavior is equivalent to manually browsing to https://google.com/ncr each time you open a new Incognito window.

For more information about the NID cookie and how Google is tracking you, please refer to their privacy policy.
